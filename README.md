# computervision
1. Give a 2D array of size nxm, which is an input image 
2. Give a kernal of size pxq 

apply max pooling for dimenssion reduction i.e. convolve kernal matrix over input image.

output image size: l*m*c

    formula used: 
     l= =m math.ceil((n-k+1/2) +1)
     c= number of chanels (R,G,B)
